This repository holds scripts for things best described as
'Not a good fit to be done in c++ / openhd core'
An example is configuring the OS for a specific camera on RPI
(This requires modifying OS-related things like the /boot/config.txt file and a reboot) 

This repo is packaged into openhd-sys-utils and can be installed from our repository
